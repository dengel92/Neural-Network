- Two types of neural network neurons: Perceptrons and sigmoid
- stochastic gradient descent = standard neural network learning algorithm

Perceptrons (first artificial neuron explained):

    -Simple mechanism explanation: perceptron takes multiple binary inputs and produces a single binary output from them
        -outputs are determined by comparing the sum of the weighted input values to a designated threshold:
Project one: Aaron API future price prediction:

    1. Draws data from API for information on prices of oil from a previous time span/ current price information
    2. uses data to find patteren to predict future price trends.
    can be applicable to justin's data?
